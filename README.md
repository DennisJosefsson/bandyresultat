# Bandyresultat

The goal of this project is to launch a site that gathers all the results from the top flights - men and women - in Swedish [bandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandy). At the moment the data is incomplete. A lot of it is missing and needs to be re-discovered by digging through the historical records, such as old newspapers. The data that do exist is scattered around the web at various places, and some sites that barely exist anymore.

The project consists of three parts: A backend based on node.js, express and PostgreSQL, a React frontend, and a web-scraper (programming language TBD, probably Python).
